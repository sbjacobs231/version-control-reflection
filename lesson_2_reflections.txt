What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You generate an empty git repository. It has no commits. The directory will be .git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the location where you send files that you want uploaded to the repository. It is the intermediate location between your working directory and the repository.
